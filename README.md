The sourcefiles are from the CVD library: http://www.edwardrosten.com/cvd/

This repository is an experimental implementation of FAST for ARM NEON compilers.

Made possible by https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon

This package is required by https://github.com/gaoxiang12/ygz-stereo-inertial
However in order to install this package on a NVIDIA Jetson Device it must be ARM compatible.
